## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
 <div class="author">
        <img class="user-pic" src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg Hooper's avatar">
        <p class="author-name">Greg Hooper</p>
      </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
      background-color: var(--color-yellow);
    height: 29px;
    width: 82px;
    font-weight: 800;
    border-radius: 4px;
    padding-left: 12px;
    padding-right: 12px;
    padding-top: 4px;
    padding-bottom: 4px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - The resources on HTML provided by W3Schools were instrumental in helping me understand the structure and semantics of web pages. I particularly appreciated the clear explanations and practical examples, which I will continue to use in future projects.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - The comprehensive guide on CSS by W3Schools significantly enhanced my understanding of styling and layout. The detailed tutorials and examples made it easier to grasp complex concepts, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their CSS skills.
